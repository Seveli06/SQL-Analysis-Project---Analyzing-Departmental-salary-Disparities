# SQL Analysis Project: Analyzing Departmental Salary Disparities

## Introduction
In this project, the goal was to analyze salary patterns across different departments to identify salary disparities and outliers. By focusing on departments with high salary variation, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can be used to ensure fairness in compensation and optimize salary structures within the organization.



## Project Overview:
 **This project involved:**

1. **Analyzing Salary Data:** Using SQL to identify departments with significant salary disparities.
2. **Identifying Outliers:** Using statistical methods like standard deviation and Z-scores to identify salary outliers.
3. **Creating a Scoring System:** Developing a variation score based on salary distribution and outliers.
4. **Flagging Departments:** Flagging departments with high salary variation for further investigation.


## Key SQL feature used: 
1. Common Table Expressions (CTE)
2. CASE Statements 
3. JOIN Operations
4. Aggregation Functions
5. WHERE Clause
6. GROUP BY and ORDER BY


## Process:
1. **Query 1**: Calculate statistics (average salary and standard deviation) by department.
2. **Query 2**: Identify salary outliers using Z-scores.
3. **Query 3**: Filter and sort results based on variation score.

## Outcome:
This analysis identifies departments with high salary variation, providing actionable insights to optimize compensation and address disparities.
